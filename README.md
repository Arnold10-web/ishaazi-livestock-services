## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- `farming-magazine-frontend`: Contains the React frontend application.
- Backend: The root directory contains the backend application, including:
    - `controllers`: Request handlers for different routes.
    - `middleware`: Custom middleware for authentication, error handling, etc.
    - `models`: Mongoose schemas for database models.
    - `routes`: Express routes for different API endpoints.
    - `services`: Business logic for various features.
    - `utils`: Utility functions.
    - `config`: Configuration files (e.g., database connection).

## Setup and Running the Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/farming_magazine
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```
5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Or, to run in development mode with nodemon:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `farming-magazine-frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd farming-magazine-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

The following scripts are available in the `package.json` file in the root directory:

- `npm start`: Starts the backend server.
- `npm run dev`: Starts the backend server in development mode with nodemon.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the backend code using ESLint.
- `npm test`: Runs backend tests using Jest.
- `npm run test:watch`: Runs backend tests in watch mode.
- `npm run test:coverage`: Generates a backend test coverage report.
- `npm run frontend:test`: Runs frontend tests.
- `npm run frontend:build`: Builds the frontend application for production.
- `npm run frontend:install`: Installs frontend dependencies.
